## Introduction

In C++ programming, comments play a crucial role in enhancing the readability, maintainability, and overall understanding of the code. They are special lines that are not executed by the compiler, serving as annotations to explain the purpose, functionality, or any other significant details about the code. Comments are particularly beneficial for both the original developers and others who may need to work with the code in the future.
