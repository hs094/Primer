Humanloop is no longer an active, standalone platform. As of now, the team behind Humanloop has been **acqui-hired** by Anthropic, and the platform itself is being **sunset**.

---

### What Happened with Humanloop?

- Humanloop announced it would **shut down the platform entirely by September 8, 2025**. After that date, its UI and APIs will no longer be available.([Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/wandb_fc/product-announcements-fc/reports/Humanloop-is-Sunsetting-Migrate-to-Weights-Biases-as-an-alternative--VmlldzoxMzk4ODc1Nw?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Humanloop is Sunsetting. Migrate to Weights & Biases as ..."), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44592216&utm_source=chatgpt.com "Tell HN: Humanloop acquired, sunsetting Sept 8th"))
    
- In parallel, **Anthropic acquired Humanloop’s team**—including its three co-founders (Raza Habib, Peter Hayes, and Jordan Burgess) and most of its engineers and researchers—but **did not acquire its IP or product**.([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/anthropic-nabs-humanloop-team-as-competition-for-enterprise-ai-talent-heats-up/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Anthropic nabs Humanloop team as competition for ..."))
    

---

### Is Humanloop Integrated with Anthropic?

- **Not in terms of the product or IP**. Humanloop’s platform is being retired rather than integrated into Anthropic in its original form.([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/anthropic-nabs-humanloop-team-as-competition-for-enterprise-ai-talent-heats-up/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Anthropic nabs Humanloop team as competition for ..."))
    
- **Yes, in terms of talent and capabilities**. Anthropic has absorbed the Humanloop team, aiming to incorporate its expertise—particularly in prompt management, evaluation, observability, and enterprise tooling—into future Claude features and infrastructure.([TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/13/anthropic-nabs-humanloop-team-as-competition-for-enterprise-ai-talent-heats-up/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Anthropic nabs Humanloop team as competition for ..."))
    

---

### Summary Table

|**Aspect**|**Current Status**|
|---|---|
|Humanloop Platform|Shutting down on September 8, 2025|
|Integration|No direct product integration with Anthropic|
|Team & Talent|Acquired by Anthropic through an “acqui-hire”|
|Future Use|Expertise likely used to enhance Claude’s enterprise tooling|

---

### What This Means for You

- If you were using Humanloop, you'll need to **export your data and migrate to an alternative platform** before the shutdown.
    
- Anthropic will **not offer the same UI or APIs**, but may develop analogous capabilities within Claude’s ecosystem, thanks to the Humanloop team’s involvement.
    
- For migration, platforms like **PromptLayer, Agenta, Keywords AI, Langfuse**, and others have stepped forward as viable replacements.([PromptLayer](https://blog.promptlayer.com/humanloop-shutdown-guide-to-migrating-your-prompts-and-evals-to-promptlayer/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "HumanLoop Shutdown: Guide to Migrating Your Prompts ..."), [Keywords AI](https://www.keywordsai.co/blog/humanloop-alternatives?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Humanloop Is Sunsetting – Exploring the Best LLM‑Ops ..."), [Kukarella](https://www.kukarella.com/news/anthropic-strengthens-enterprise-ai-with-humanloop-team-acquisition?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Anthropic Strengthens Enterprise AI with Humanloop Team ..."), [Future Tools](https://futuretools.beehiiv.com/p/anthropic-snaps-up-humanloop-s-humans?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Anthropic snaps up Humanloop's humans - Future Tools"))
