These are used as a mechanism to distribute tasks across workers. (Threads, Machines)

Celery communicates via messages, usually using a broker to mediate between clients and workers. To initiate a task the client adds a message to the queue, the broker then delivers that message to a worker.

A Celery system can consist of multiple workers and brokers, giving way to high availability and horizontal scaling.

Language interoperability can also be achieved exposing an HTTP endpoint and having a task that requests it (webhooks).
